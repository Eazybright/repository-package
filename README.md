## Introduction

This package main purpose is to manage repository design pattern in your laravel projects. It helps you create your repository and interface files respectively with a single command.

## Installation

To install this package run:

```bash
composer require eazybright/repository-package
```
This will install the package into your project.

## Usage
Next, create a repostory file by running:
```bash
php artisan repository:create Blog
```

Make sure to provide your own argument name when running the above command, I used *Blog* as an example.

Once the command run, it creates the repository files `App\Repositories\BlogRepository.php`, `App\Repositories\Interfaces\BlogRepositoryInterface.php` and also create a service provider file in `App\Providers\RepositoryServiceProvider.php`.

You need to register the service provider. Open up `config/app.php` and add the following to the `providers` key.

```php
'providers' => [
    ...
    App\Providers\RepositoryServiceProvider::class,
    ...
]
```

The Repository file will be registered into `RepositoryServiceProvider::class` whenever it is created.

```php
<?php
...
    use App\Repositories\Interfaces\BlogRepositoryInterface;
    use App\Repositories\BlogRepository;

    ...

    public function register()
    {
        $this->app->bind(
            BlogRepositoryInterface::class,
            BlogRepository::class
        )
    }
...
```
